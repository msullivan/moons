# Qaia Moon Reference

Generated from `bodies.js` parameters. Re-run `node analysis/moon_stats.mjs` after any changes.

Qaia's Hill sphere: **3.89 LD**. All values assume lunar geometric albedo (~0.12) for brightness.
Quartus (1.00 LD, 1 M_moon) is used as the reference body throughout.

## Primus — retrograde

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 0.020 M_moon |
| Radius | 374 km (0.215 R_moon) |
| Density | 6,689 kg/m³ — **2× lunar**, near-iron |
| Semi-major axis | 0.12 LD |
| Period | 1.14 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 55.8′ mean (50.7′–62.0′) — **1.80× Quartus** |
| Full-moon brightness | **−14.0** (1.27 mag brighter than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 0.700 m/s² (0.43× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 1.76 M km² (4.6% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 724 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | **11.6× Quartus** |
| Hill sphere fraction | 3.1% |
| Roche margin | 6.1× (rigid body) |

Despite being a tiny body, Primus is the most visually dominant moon — it appears nearly twice the angular size of Quartus and is brighter, because it's so close. Its 1.14-day period and retrograde direction mean it **rises in the west and sets in the east**. At 6,690 kg/m³ it is denser than Earth (5,510) and nearly as dense as iron. Its tidal effect on Qaia is 11.6× that of Quartus — by far the dominant tide-driver despite its small mass.

## Secundus — retrograde

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 0.040 M_moon |
| Radius | 471 km (0.271 R_moon) |
| Density | 6,689 kg/m³ — 2× lunar, near-iron |
| Semi-major axis | 0.24 LD |
| Period | 3.23 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 35.1′ mean (31.9′–39.0′) — 1.13× Quartus |
| Full-moon brightness | **−13.0** (0.27 mag brighter than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 0.882 m/s² (0.54× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 2.79 M km² (7.4% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 912 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | 2.9× Quartus |
| Hill sphere fraction | 6.2% |
| Roche margin | 7.7× |

At mean distance Secundus appears almost exactly the same angular size as Quartus; near periapsis it is noticeably larger. Also retrograde — likely a sibling body to Primus, same density suggesting shared origin or composition. Contributes nearly 3× Quartus's tidal effect.

| Tidal force on Qaia | 2.7× Quartus |
| Hill sphere fraction | 11.6% |
| Roche margin | 9.7× |

A substantial rocky world — larger in the sky than our Moon. Prograde, 8.3-day period. Surface area roughly comparable to Russia (17 M km²). Tidal contribution similar to Secundus.

|---|---|
| Mass | 1.000 M_moon |
| Radius | 1,737 km (1.000 R_moon) |
| Density | 3,344 kg/m³ — lunar |
| Semi-major axis | 1.00 LD |
| Period | 27.45 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 31.1′ mean (28.2′–34.5′) |

| Tidal force on Qaia | 1.00× (reference) |
| Hill sphere fraction | 25.7% |
| Roche margin | 40.5× |

A clone of Earth's Moon at the same distance and mass. The natural calendar body. Appears the smallest of the four inner moons in the sky.

## Sextus — retrograde

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 0.010 M_moon |
| Radius | 374 km (0.215 R_moon) |
| Density | 3,344 kg/m³ — lunar |
| Semi-major axis | 1.90 LD |
| Period | 71.9 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 3.5′ mean (3.2′–3.9′) — 0.11× Quartus |
| Full-moon brightness | **−8.0** (4.73 mag dimmer than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 0.350 m/s² (0.22× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 1.76 M km² (4.6% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 512 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | ~0.001× Quartus |
| Hill sphere fraction | 48.8% |
| Roche margin | 12.2× |

Visible as a small disc (~4× the apparent diameter of Jupiter from Earth). At −8.0 dramatically brighter than any planet but clearly not a full moon. Retrograde. At 48.8% of the Hill sphere, stable for a retrograde orbit (limit ~70%) but would be completely unstable if prograde (~33% limit).

## Septimus — retrograde

| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 3.0′ mean (2.8′–3.4′) — 0.098× Quartus |

| Roche margin | 14.1× |

Physically identical to Sextus but 16% farther out — slightly smaller and dimmer in the sky. At 56.5% of the Hill sphere, the most precariously placed moon. ~90-day period makes it a useful long-calendar body.

## System Notes

**Combined tidal load**: Primus (×11.6) + Secundus (×2.9) + Tertius (×2.7) + Quartus (×1.0) ≈ **18× our Moon's total tidal force**. Ocean tides on Qaia are extreme and complex.

**All four inner moons appear larger than our Moon** in Qaia's sky. Quartus at 31′ is the *smallest* of the four.

**Retrograde moons** (Primus, Secundus, Sextus, Septimus) rise in the west. A nighttime observer sees two dense, fast metallic moons sweeping east-to-west and two larger ones moving west-to-east.

**Density split**: Primus and Secundus at 6,690 kg/m³ are likely iron-rich captured bodies or fragments of a differentiated progenitor. The rest are standard rocky at lunar density.

**Tidal migration**: Retrograde moons lose energy to tidal friction and spiral *inward* over geological time (opposite to our Moon). Primus and Secundus are very slowly approaching Qaia. Primus is 6.1× outside its Roche limit and in no near-term danger.

**Tidal locking**: All inner moons are almost certainly synchronously rotating — tidal locking timescale scales as a⁶, so Primus at 0.12 LD locks in a tiny fraction of the time needed for Quartus.

**Quintus** is a trace particle at the Sun-Qaia L4 point (60° ahead of Qaia). It librates between ~45° and ~80° from Qaia with a period of ~2,000 years. Effectively massless — included for worldbuilding purposes.
