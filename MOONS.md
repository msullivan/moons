# Qaia Moon Reference

Generated from `bodies.js` parameters. Re-run `node analysis/moon_stats.mjs` after any changes.

Qaia's Hill sphere: **3.89 LD**. All values assume lunar geometric albedo (~0.12) for brightness.
Quartus (1.00 LD, 1 M_moon) is used as the reference body throughout.

## Secundus — retrograde

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 0.040 M_moon |
| Radius | 471 km (0.271 R_moon) |
| Density | 6,689 kg/m³ — **2× lunar**, near-iron |
| Semi-major axis | 0.24 LD |
| Period | 3.23 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 35.1′ mean (31.9′–39.0′) — **1.13× Quartus** |
| Full-moon brightness | **−13.0** (0.27 mag brighter than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 0.882 m/s² (0.54× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 2.79 M km² (7.4% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 912 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | **2.9× Quartus** |
| Hill sphere fraction | 6.2% |
| Roche margin | 12.3× (rigid body) |

The innermost moon, retrograde — rises in the west and sets in the east. At 6,690 kg/m³ it is denser than Earth (5,510) and nearly as dense as iron, suggesting an iron-rich captured body or fragment of a differentiated progenitor. At 35′ it appears slightly larger than Quartus; near periapsis noticeably so.

| Density | 3,344 kg/m³ — lunar |
| Semi-major axis | 0.45 LD |
| Period | 8.29 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 43.5′ mean (39.5′–48.3′) — 1.40× Quartus |
| Full-moon brightness | **−13.5** (0.73 mag brighter than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 1.023 m/s² (0.63× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 15.05 M km² (39.7% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 1,496 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | 2.7× Quartus |
| Hill sphere fraction | 11.6% |
| Roche margin | 18.2× (rigid body) |

A substantial rocky world — larger in the sky than our Moon. Prograde, 8.3-day period. Surface area roughly comparable to Russia (17 M km²). Tidal contribution similar to Secundus.

## Quartus — prograde *(reference)*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 1.000 M_moon |
| Radius | 1,737 km (1.000 R_moon) |
| Density | 3,344 kg/m³ — lunar |
| Semi-major axis | 1.00 LD |
| Period | 27.45 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 31.1′ mean (28.2′–34.5′) |
| Full-moon brightness | **−12.74** |
| Surface gravity | 1.624 m/s² |
| Surface area | 37.91 M km² |
| Escape velocity | 2,375 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | 1.00× (reference) |
| Hill sphere fraction | 25.7% |
| Roche margin | 40.5× (rigid body) |

A clone of Earth's Moon at the same distance and mass. The natural calendar body. Appears the smallest of the three inner moons in the sky.

## Sextus — retrograde

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 0.010 M_moon |
| Radius | 374 km (0.215 R_moon) |
| Density | 3,344 kg/m³ — lunar |
| Semi-major axis | 1.90 LD |
| Period | 71.9 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 3.5′ mean (3.2′–3.9′) — 0.11× Quartus |
| Full-moon brightness | **−8.0** (4.73 mag dimmer than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 0.350 m/s² (0.22× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 1.76 M km² (4.6% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 512 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | ~0.001× Quartus |
| Hill sphere fraction | 48.8% |
| Roche margin | 77.0× (rigid body) |

Visible as a small disc (~4× the apparent diameter of Jupiter from Earth). At −8.0 dramatically brighter than any planet but clearly not a full moon. Retrograde. At 48.8% of the Hill sphere, stable for a retrograde orbit (limit ~70%) but would be completely unstable if prograde (~33% limit).

## Septimus — retrograde

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Mass | 0.010 M_moon |
| Radius | 374 km (0.215 R_moon) |
| Density | 3,344 kg/m³ — lunar |
| Semi-major axis | 2.20 LD |
| Period | 89.6 days |
| Eccentricity | 0.10 |
| Angular diameter | 3.0′ mean (2.8′–3.4′) — 0.098× Quartus |
| Full-moon brightness | **−7.7** (5.05 mag dimmer than Quartus) |
| Surface gravity | 0.350 m/s² (0.22× Quartus) |
| Surface area | 1.76 M km² (4.6% of Quartus) |
| Escape velocity | 512 m/s |
| Tidal force on Qaia | ~0.001× Quartus |
| Hill sphere fraction | 56.5% |
| Roche margin | 89.2× (rigid body) |

Physically identical to Sextus but 16% farther out — slightly smaller and dimmer in the sky. At 56.5% of the Hill sphere, the most precariously placed moon. ~90-day period makes it a useful long-calendar body.

## System Notes

**Combined tidal load**: Secundus (×2.9) + Tertius (×2.7) + Quartus (×1.0) ≈ **6.6× our Moon's total tidal force**. Ocean tides on Qaia are significant and complex.

**All three inner moons appear larger than our Moon** in Qaia's sky. Quartus at 31′ is the *smallest* of the three.

**Retrograde moons** (Secundus, Sextus, Septimus) rise in the west. A nighttime observer sees one dense, fast metallic moon sweeping east-to-west and one larger one moving west-to-east.

**Density split**: Secundus at 6,690 kg/m³ is likely an iron-rich captured body or fragment of a differentiated progenitor. The rest are standard rocky at lunar density.

**Tidal migration**: Retrograde moons lose energy to tidal friction and spiral *inward* over geological time (opposite to our Moon). Secundus is very slowly approaching Qaia, well outside its Roche limit.

**Tidal locking**: All inner moons are almost certainly synchronously rotating — tidal locking timescale scales as a⁶, so Secundus at 0.24 LD locks far faster than Quartus.

**Quintus** is a trace particle at the Sun-Qaia L4 point (60° ahead of Qaia). It librates between ~45° and ~80° from Qaia with a period of ~2,000 years. Effectively massless — included for worldbuilding purposes.
