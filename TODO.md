## World-building / RPG utility

- **Sky view panel** — horizon-to-horizon strip showing where each moon sits in Qaia's sky
  (azimuth + altitude), scaled by apparent size.
- **Calendar system** — Tertius (~8.3 d) as a natural week, Quartus (~27.5 d) as a month;
  live fictional date display.
- **Conjunction/opposition markers** — flag when two or more moons are within N° of each
  other or in opposition; useful for "great conjunction" story events.

## Simulation depth

- **Eclipse detection** — solar eclipses (moon crosses solar disc) and lunar eclipses (moon
  enters Qaia's shadow). Phase panel geometry is already halfway there.
- **Live tide gauge** — bar or waveform showing current combined tidal height from real moon
  positions, rather than the pre-baked equilibrium model in TIDES.md.

## Visual polish

- **Phase names** in the phase panel (New / Crescent / Quarter / Gibbous / Full).
- **Smoother continents** — Bézier curves instead of polygon vertices; optional atmospheric
  limb glow on Qaia.
- **Quintus libration path** — faint arc around L4 to make its motion legible.
